Hi, my name is José Jaime Comé. 
I hold Statistics and Software Engineering master's degree. For more than 10 years I have been working in data science (including Machine Learning) and fullstack software development.
My preference now is to work with: Laravel, Django, Vuejs, Reatjs, PowerBI, Excel, R, Python, PHP and SQL. Sometimes I create maps in ArcGIS Pro and nice reports in Adobe Ilustrator. Before, I worked years with android mobile app development using Java.
